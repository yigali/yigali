- 👋 Hi, I’m @yigali
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting between the quantum computing and machine learning!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the classical machine learning basics along my main research.
- 🌱 My main research is in quantum information, with current focus on developing methods to use currently existing quantum computers to simulate otherwise hard-to-study physical models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above, if you have an expertise in machine learning and would want to "go quantum" - let us talk!
- 📫 You are most welcome to reach me on my LinkedIn (yigal-ilin-63376411a) or via an email yigal.ilin@gmail.com.
